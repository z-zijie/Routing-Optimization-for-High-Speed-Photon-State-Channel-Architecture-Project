# Routing-Optimization-for-High-Speed-Photon-State-Channel-Architecture-Project
During 2018 Oct I stayed in Nanjing beginning my first research experience meanwhile getting my first paper. When I came in the Project, the simulated Photon system always crashes. After many days and nights modifying and debugging, I proposed new algorithm to improve the stability of the photon network. My communication skills also improved through writing dozens of pages of simulation experiment report discussing with advisors Prof. Xiaowei Ding, Dr. Peter Yan. Although it was not a full success but just intrigued me to study harder in Statistic and Computer Science and only in that way I would be unflappable by most such conundrums. You may see some of my works here.
